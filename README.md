SwiftInfo is a simple CLI tool that extracts and analyzes metrics that are useful for Swift apps. Besides the default tracking options that are shipped with the tool, you can also customize SwiftInfo to track pretty much anything that can be conveyed in a simple `.swift` script.

## Usage

SwiftInfo requires the raw logs of a succesful test/archive build combo to work, so it's better used as the last step of a CI pipeline.
